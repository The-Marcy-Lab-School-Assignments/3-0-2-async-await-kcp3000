# Question

This code snippet makes a fetch to get the first todo item from the JSON placeholder API. Or at least it tries to.

What is wrong with this code? 

Describe how async/await helps us avoid this mistake.

```js
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Fetch failed!');
    response.json();
  })
  .then(json => console.log(json))
  .catch(err => console.log(err))
```

You can run this code of course, but try not to! Try to figure out the issue on your own.

# Answer

You have to return the `response.json();` in order for the fetch to work as intended. 

With `async`/`await`, you don't have to return anything, all you need to do is add the `await` portion to the `response.json();` (while inside a variable) for it to work.

So something like this:

```js
  const data = await data.json();
  console.log(data) //should print out data
```
