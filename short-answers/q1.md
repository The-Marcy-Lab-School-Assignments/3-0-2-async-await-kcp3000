# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer

`async`/`await` is formatted in a way that's both linear and in a readable flow; there's no abrupt cuts like `.then`/`.catch` and its chains.

Also not having to write a ton of callbacks is always a plus.


# Teacher Feedback

Yes! Especially getting rid of callbacks!
